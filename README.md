## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes are visual guides that represent the skeletal framework of a website or app. They help designers and developers plan the layout and user interface before actual development.

### Common Types of Wireframes:

- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Simple sketches or basic layouts focusing on structure and content placement without detailed design.
- **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes:** More detailed, often digital, showing layout and interface elements but without final visuals or colors.
- **High-Fidelity Wireframes:** Detailed and close to the final design, including fonts, colors, and interactive elements.

Wireframes are essential in the design process because they help clarify requirements, improve communication, and identify potential usability issues early on.
